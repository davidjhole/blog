##Hello and welcome to my blog.

My name is David Hole and i have been working in the tech industry for over 20 years, most of them have been in a sysadmin/IT Manager/OPS role but for the last few years i have been working with the cloud specifically Azure.

Azure has helped me rediscover my love for tech with it's ever changing ecosystem there is always something new to try or learn, while this is a challenge to keep up with everything it also excites me to learn more.
