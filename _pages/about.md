## Hello and welcome to my blog.

My name is David Hole and I have been working in the tech industry for over 20 years, most of them have been in a sysadmin/IT Manager/OPS role but for the last few years I have been working with the cloud specifically Azure.

Azure has helped me rediscover my love and passion for tech with it's ever changing ecosystem there is always something new to try or learn, while this can be a challenge to keep up with, it also excites me to learn more.  

When i'm disconnected from technology I have two wonderful children that keep me on my toes and can often be found enjoying a countryside walk with the wife and our cockapoo puppy.


### Why have I decided to do this?

I have been toying with the idea to do this for a while and theres no better time than the present.  

I'm hoping that this will turn into a place where I can share my ramblings, scripts, and other (hopefully) helpful information so that it may help someone else.
